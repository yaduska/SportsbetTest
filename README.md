# Sportsbet Test Application
 
 - It processes ticket transactions and returns customer details and the transaction ID based on the input request.   
   
## Technologies used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot version 3.5
- Gradle version 8.14
- JUnit 5 for unit testing
- SLF4J for logging

## Running the application
- Run via Gradle:  './gradlew bootrun'
- or run from the IDE: Right click the main class ->  Run as ->  Spring Boot App

## Running the tests
- Run via Gradle: ./gradlew test
- or run from the IDE: Right click the test class-> Run as -> JUnit Test  

## Checking the endpoints
- Swagger UI:  /swagger-ui.html (http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
- or else can be checked using third party tools like Postman

> **Note:** Decimal values are formatted to show up to 2 decimal places correctly in Postman responses.  
> However, Swagger UI may sometimes display full precision without rounding or formatting decimals.
     
## Assumptions made
- Returns the same transaction ID received in the request
- Using BigDecimal though it takes more space in the memory than other data types like Double
  to make sure the accuracy since the transactions are made using currency and with 2 decimal point 
  as the response is expected to display values with 2 decimal points
- Using the external properties file to make sure the age,prices and percentages can be changed in
  future  
- Added Validations for the customer age,customer name,customer list and the transaction Id based on the following assumptions           
   -Transaction Id must be positive
   -customer list cannot be empty
   -customer name must not be null or empty 
   -age should be between 0â€“150 
- Controller tests have not been implemented as the controller only  delegates requests to the service layer without containing any business logic
- Added the prices, age limit and the percentage in the application.yml file as I thought it can be altered in the future 


## Can be implemented in the future
- Implement Security using JWT tokens or other authentication mechanisms
